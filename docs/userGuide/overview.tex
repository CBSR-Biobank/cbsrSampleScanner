\chapter{Overview}
The CBSR Sample Scanner is a Microsoft Windows application that decodes
DataMatrix encoded tubes to be decoded. It communicates with a scanner that
uses either TWAIN\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWAIN}} or
WIA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Image_Acquisition}}
drivers. Most scanners available on the market provide these
drivers.

Figure \ref{fig:main_window} shows the application's main window and highlights
some of its components.

\item[Window Title Bar] The title bar shows the connection information when
  connected to a BioBank2 server. The domain name or IP address of the server
  is displayed and in square brackets the user name that was used to log in.
\item[Main Menu] The main menu allows the user access to the different
  functions provided by the software (see section \ref{sec:main_menu} for a
  description of the menu items).
\item[Toolbar Icons] The icon buttons in the toolbar allow quick access to
  often used menu items. Using the mouse, the user can hover over the icon
  button and after 2 seconds a tooltip is displayed describing what the
  button is for and if applicable the keyboard shortcut. Note that there is
  an icon toolbar under the Main Menu and another grouped with the tree view.
\item[Tree View] The tree view shown here is for the \emph{Administration
  View}. The application uses tree views in the \emph{Administration View}
  and \emph{Processing View} (see section \ref{sec:application_views}). Tree
  view shows nodes in a hierarchical structure. If a node has children, a
  \emph{plus} symbol is displayed next to the node. When the symbol is
  pressed the node will expand to show its' child nodes.  Sometimes,
  operations can be performed on certain nodes in the tree by right clicking
  with the mouse on the node.
\item[Status Bar] The status bar is used to display the current state of the
  application. It is usually updated after the user has completed a task.
