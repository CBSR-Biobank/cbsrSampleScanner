\chapter{Overview}
The BioBank2 Java Client is designed to be a client application that connects
to a BioBank2 server that provides services for storing inventory information
for biological samples. More than one client can connect to the server at the
same time. The client is a software application that runs on Microsoft Windows
and Linux\footnote{The scanner cannot be used when using the application on
  Linux.}. The client software is a Java application and requires that a Java
JRE or JDK be installed on the computer. The installation program for the
client installs a Java JRE if it is not already present on the computer.

When running on Microsoft Windows, the client can communicate with scanners
that use either TWAIN\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWAIN}} or
WIA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Image_Acquisition}}
drivers. Most scanners available on the market provide these
drivers. Therefore, most scanners work with the client software.

The client does not store any inventory information on the computer that it
runs on. All the information is stored on the server. Any client connecting to
this server will be able to see all the information on the server.

Figure \ref{fig:main_window} shows the application's main window and highlights
some of its components.

\item[Window Title Bar] The title bar shows the connection information when
  connected to a BioBank2 server. The domain name or IP address of the server
  is displayed and in square brackets the user name that was used to log in.
\item[Main Menu] The main menu allows the user access to the different
  functions provided by the software (see section \ref{sec:main_menu} for a
  description of the menu items).
\item[Toolbar Icons] The icon buttons in the toolbar allow quick access to
  often used menu items. Using the mouse, the user can hover over the icon
  button and after 2 seconds a tooltip is displayed describing what the
  button is for and if applicable the keyboard shortcut. Note that there is
  an icon toolbar under the Main Menu and another grouped with the tree view.
\item[Tree View] The tree view shown here is for the \emph{Administration
  View}. The application uses tree views in the \emph{Administration View}
  and \emph{Processing View} (see section \ref{sec:application_views}). Tree
  view shows nodes in a hierarchical structure. If a node has children, a
  \emph{plus} symbol is displayed next to the node. When the symbol is
  pressed the node will expand to show its' child nodes.  Sometimes,
  operations can be performed on certain nodes in the tree by right clicking
  with the mouse on the node.
\item[Status Bar] The status bar is used to display the current state of the
  application. It is usually updated after the user has completed a task.
