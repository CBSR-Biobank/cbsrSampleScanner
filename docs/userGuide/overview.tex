\chapter{Overview}
The CBSR Sample Scanner is a Microsoft Windows application that decodes
DataMatrix encoded 1.0 ml or 0.5 ml tubes inserted into NUNC 96 well plates. It
communicates with a scanner that uses either
TWAIN\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWAIN}} or
WIA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Image_Acquisition}}
drivers. Most scanners available on the market provide these drivers.

Up to 5 pallets can be scanned and decoded at a time. The product IDs of
decoded pallets can be saved to individual files that specify the pallet
product ID and the date and time the scan was performed. Files are saved in
Comma Separated Value (CSV) format which is a plain text format or can be
imported in to Microsoft Excel.

Figure \ref{fig:main_window} shows the application's main window and highlights
some of its components. This figure shows the application when it is configured
to scan a single pallet.

\begin{description}
\item[Main Menu] (labelled \emph{1}) Allows the user access to the
  different functions provided by the software (see section \ref{sec:main_menu}
  for a description of the menu items).
\item [Pallet Product IDs] (labelled \emph{2}) The product ID of the of the
  pallets to be scanned. This product ID is used in the output file. These text
  boxes are enabled or disabled based on which plates are enabled in the
  preferences.
\item [Decoding Profile] (labelled \emph{3}) Scanning profiles control which
  tubes on the pallet will be decoded. Profiles are described in detail in
  section \ref{sec:decoding_profiles}.
\item [Decode Results] (labelled \emph{4}) This part of the window shows the
  decoded product IDs of the tubes that were decoded for each pallet.
\item [Status Bar] (labelled \emph{5}) The status bar is used to display the
  current state of the application. It is usually updated after the user has
  completed a task.
